# Events Management Application

## Setup & Run Instructions

### Using Docker (recommended)

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd events-management
   ```
3. Start the full stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   The following services will be available:
   - **Backend API** ‚Äì http://localhost:3000
   - **Frontend (Next.js)** ‚Äì http://localhost:5000
   - **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì localhost:5432 (`postgres` / `postgres`)
   - **pgAdmin** ‚Äì http://localhost:8888 (login: `root@postgres.com` / `postgres`)

4- register user and start using the app and create events and rsvp to others events.

The containers watch the source folders (`backend/src`, `frontend/src`) so any code changes trigger hot-reload without rebuilding the image.

### Local development without Docker

1. Install **Node.js >= 20** and **pnpm** (or npm).
2. Create a `.env` file in `backend` and `frontend` (see `.env.docker` for examples).
3. In two terminals:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run start:dev

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Ensure you have a local PostgreSQL instance running that matches the credentials in `.env` or use Docker just for the database.

## Technology Choices & Reasoning

- Backend:

  - Tech: NestJS 11 + TypeScript

  - Why: Modular architecture, first-class TypeScript support, built-in DI & validation.

- Database ORM:

  - Tech: Sequelize

  - Why: Mature, feature-rich ORM that integrates well with Postgres and supports TypeScript decorators via sequelize-typescript.

- Auth:

  - Tech: JWT (via @nestjs/jwt) + BCrypt

  - Why: Stateless authentication & secure password hashing.

- Frontend:

  - Tech: Next.js 14 (App Router, Turbopack)

  - Why: File-system routing, React 18, fast dev server, SEO-friendly.

- Containerisation:

  - Tech: Docker & Docker Compose

  - Why: Simplifies onboarding; reproducible dev & prod environments.

- Database:

  - Tech: PostgreSQL 16

  - Why: Open-source, reliable relational DB; strong JSON & indexing support.

## What I Would Improve With More Time

- Add unit, integration & e2e test suites (Jest + Supertest + Playwright).
- Add params to swagger docs.
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions ‚ûú Docker registry ‚ûú cloud hosting).
- adding payment gateway (e.g. Stripe).
- Role-based access control and fine-grained permissions.
- Adding real-time notifications (e.g. WebSockets).
- Adding email notifications (e.g. SendGrid).
- Adding loaders for better experience.
- Adding sorting for better experience.
- Adding search for better experience.

## Assumptions

- Users authenticate via JSON Web Tokens included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- Minimal error handling for brevity ‚Äì client should handle non-200 responses.
- Dates are sent and stored in ISO 8601 UTC strings.
- Pagination defaults to `page=1&limit=20` when omitted.
- using transaction for events and rsvps.
- .env files uploaded for running the project easily.

## API Endpoint Documentation

The API is prefixed with `/events/v1` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/events/v1`). All responses are JSON.

### Auth

| Method | Endpoint         | Body (JSON)                                             | Response                      |
